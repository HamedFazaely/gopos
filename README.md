# GOPOS

GOPOS is another implementation of ISO8583 protocol.
The project is meant to be a port of [JPOS](https://github.com/jpos/jPOS), which is written in Java, to golang, so many of its ideas and design principles are taken directly from [JPOS](https://github.com/jpos/jPOS). Of course there may be deviations from [JPOS](https://github.com/jpos/jPOS) wherever it fits the project.
